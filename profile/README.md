## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the organization that hosts all the resources of the TFG VIVIDUS project.

VIVIDUS is an application that seeks to support those interested in violent video classification and anomaly detection by offering video inference and model evaluation services.

The code of the video classification models is not of our authorship. Those are modifications of existing models to perform tests on the proposed application. The original authors and repositories are referenced in each respective repository.

The code of the features extractor is not of our authorship either.
